## About The Project

### What's This About:
Welcome to the 'Yoga Style eShop' backend project! This is a complementary component to the frontend, aimed at supporting the e-commerce platform's functionality. The primary focus here is to strengthen skills in backend development, including building RESTful APIs, handling authentication, managing databases, and integrating with third-party services.

### How It's Set Up:
The backend part of this project is hosted on a [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) server, ensuring full control and customization over the hosting environment. 
Additionally, [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database), a fully managed cloud database service, is utilized for storing and managing data. 
MongoDB Atlas offers a flexible, scalable, and reliable solution for database hosting, allowing seamless integration with Node.js applications.

The corresponding frontend for this project is available in my repository, located at [Yoga-Style-eShop-frontend repository](https://github.com/RalitsaLefterova/Yoga-Style-eShop-frontend).

### Always Learning:
Similar to the frontend counterpart, this backend project is a work in progress and subject to continuous improvement and refinement. 

### What's Next:
I'll continue to enhance the backend functionalities, optimize performance, and ensure scalability. Additionally, I'll explore new techniques, tools, and integrations to make the backend system more robust and efficient.

<!-- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), a MongoDB object modeling tool, serves as the primary interface for interacting with MongoDB Atlas in the backend. 
Mongoose simplifies the process of defining schemas, performing CRUD operations, and enforcing data validation within Node.js applications. -->
